    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",

Currently only `__doc__` strings are removed from the bytecode, resulting in more compact **`.pyo`** files. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you’re doing.\n",

    "\n",
    "* When a script is run by giving its name on the command line, the bytecode for the script is never written to a **`.pyc`** or **`.pyo`** file. Thus, the startup time of a script may be reduced by moving most of its code to a module and having a small bootstrap script that imports that module. It is also possible to name a **`.pyc`** or **`.pyo`** file directly on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is possible to have a file called **`spam.pyc`** (or **`spam.pyo`** when `-O` is used) without a file **`spam.py`** for the same module. This can be used to distribute a library of Python code in a form that is moderately hard to reverse engineer.\n",

Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or the Python Imaging Library from having to worry about each other’s module names.\n",

There are also many different operations you might want to perform on sound data (such as mixing, adding echo, applying an equalizer function, creating an artificial stereo effect), so in addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to perform these operations.
